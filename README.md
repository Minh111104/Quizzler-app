# Quizzler-app
This is a Python-based quiz application that uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to present users with a series of multiple-choice questions. The app tracks the user's score as they answer the questions and provides feedback after each question.

## Features
- The quiz is based on questions fetched from the `question_data list`.
- It uses object-oriented programming principles with classes such as `Question`, `QuizBrain`, and `QuizInterface`.
- The application presents each question one by one and keeps track of the user's score.
- It includes a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to make the quiz more interactive.
